> # HPE CodeWars 2024 Problems
> This is a repository was used by the Computer Science Club at CLHS to prepare for HPE CodeWars 2025. It includes solutions to some problems from the 2024 competition in both Java and Python programming languages. This repository also includes the files to check problems accross the real datasets used during the competiton. If you found this repository helpful or would like to refrence it in the future please leave us a star! :star:
> 
> __To Test Problems:__
> 1. Clone the Repository
> 2. Move choosen problem file into the main directory
> 3. Run ```checkProb.py``` or ```checkProb.bat```
> 4. Compare Output and Expected Output in the console
> 5. Refer back to `HPECodeWars2024Problems.pdf` to revisit the problem   
> 6. If you have any problems/questions refer to `defaultREADME.txt` or open a Issue in this Repository and we will do our best to answer it!

|10|Finished.. questionable?|
|11|eeh??|
|12|def inefficient, set??.. Remove duplicate as adding?|
|13||
|14|Try-Catch & Clearing non-digits|
|15|StringBuilder|
|16|seems like the most convoluted solution ever. Treemaps, sorting maps via stream/collections|
|17|Functionally Queues (as arraylist), MultiMap/Hashmaps|
|18|feels slow. read graph via char arrays, 2d array-ish|
|19|Modulus division, converting time|
|20|Arraylist of Arraylists, line scanner|
|21||
|22|BUGGED, perhaps use a StringBuilder? Math.round(), converting to float|
|23||
|24|solved in python: used string manipulation methods and os to get files|
