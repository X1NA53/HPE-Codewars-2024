|10|Finished.. questionable?|
|11|eeh??|
|12|def inefficient, set??.. Remove duplicate as adding?|
|13||
|14|Try-Catch & Clearing non-digits|
|15|StringBuilder|
|16|seems like the most convoluted solution ever. Treemaps, sorting maps via stream/collections|
|17|Functionally Queues (as arraylist), MultiMap/Hashmaps|
|18|feels slow. read graph via char arrays, 2d array-ish|
|19|Modulus division, converting time|
|20|Arraylist of Arraylists, line scanner|
|21||
|22|BUGGED, perhaps use a StringBuilder? Math.round(), converting to float|
